Céleste Fontaine, founded in 1989 by Céleste Nyoma Fontaine in Lagos, Nigeria, is a brand that stands as a beacon of luxury and cultural sophistication. Originally envisioned as a fashion house that captured the essence of Nigerian elegance, Céleste’s passion for style set the stage for what would become an iconic name in Nigerian fashion. However, it was her young and energetic daughter who truly revitalized the brand in the 1990s, aligning it with the tech-savvy and innovative demands of the modern era.
In the late 2000s, Céleste Fontaine transformed into a global brand, appealing especially to the young, nouveau riche Nigerian elite who embody a new wave of international influence and taste. Catering to these affluent, trend-setting individuals, the brand blends the richness of Nigerian heritage with contemporary design and cutting-edge technology, making it a favorite among the emerging class of young, international Nigerians who value both tradition and innovation.
